I work on computational and theoretical modeling of cytoskeletal polymers to understand their
mechanical properties and their role in biological processes such as wound healing.
I am a postdoctoral research associate at Rochester Institute of Technology in 
[Prof. Moumita Das'](https://www.rit.edu/directory/modsps-moumita-das) group.

In projects during my Ph.D under the mentorship of [Dr. Wouter-Jan Rappel](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=1aJwIRkAAAAJ)
at UC San Diego, I used data-driven modeling approaches to understand reaction 
pathways in chemotaxis of the social amoeba Dictyostelium. I have also worked
on modeling the reaction networks in plant guard cells using Boolean networks.

You can read more about the projects and view my publications **here**. 

My academic journey has taken me to these cities from Ananatapur in Andhra Pradesh,
India, where I was born and raised.

üáÆüá≥ Anantapur (1994-2010) ‚û°Ô∏è Hyderabad (2010-12) ‚û°Ô∏è Bangalore (2012-17)
‚û°Ô∏è üá∫üá∏ San Digeo (2017-24) ‚û°Ô∏è Rochester (2024-*)

I can speak English, ‡∞§‡±Ü‡∞≤‡±Å‡∞ó‡±Å, ‡≤ï‡≤®‡≥ç‡≤®‡≤°, ‡§π‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ä fairly well. I am learning ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§Æ‡•ç, Spanish, and German.
Looking forward to growing the list!

I have volunteered for [Asha for Education](sd.ashanet.org) in San Diego and 
[Notebook Drive](https://www.facebook.com/notebookdrive.iisc/) in Bangalore
for a number of years. Both organisations work to improve educational access and outcomes
among underprivileged children in India.

I am also greatly interested in teaching. I am an enthusiastic runner. I enjoy cricket, cooking, and chai.

It is my firm belief that bowlers win you [test matches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket).
All other beliefs are subject to change.
