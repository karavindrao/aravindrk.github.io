## <span style="color: blue;">Computational modeling of network restructuring in active cytoskeletal composites</span>

Active Cytoskeletal Composites (ACCs), composed of actin and microtubule filaments,
active motors, and passive crosslinkers. They display novel mechanical properties that
can be harnessed to synthesize controllable active materials. We model the dynamics of
the composites using large-scale Brownian Dynamics simulations to predict the 
restructuring of the composite and to inform the formulation of hydrodynamic theories.

## <span style="color: blue;">Computational and theoretical modeling of the cytoskeleton of *Stentor coeruleus* to understand its wound healing abilities</span>

The single-celled ciliate \textsl{Stentor coeruleus} can withstand substantial mechanical
deformation and can also heal large wounds. Our  work studies the response of *Stentor*'s
cytoskeleton to large-scale damage, coupled with calcium signaling triggered by the wound 
formation. This study offers insights into wound-healing mechanisms at the level of 
individual cells.

## <span style="color: blue;">Analysis and modeling of eukaryotic chemotaxis under periodic stimuli</span>

An analysis of the chemotaxis of the social amoeba *Dictyostelium discoideum*, when
exposed to multiple waves of the chemoattractant, showed that the chemotactic ability
of the cells improves upon exposure to more waves provided the wave period is small. 
A model for this frequency-dependent growth in chemotactic ability was developed that
was also compatible with earlier studies. The improvement in chemotaxis was shown to 
involve temporal gradient sensing besides spatial gradient sensing, while earlier 
models focused solely on the latter.

## <span style="color: blue;">Boolean modeling of guard cell signaling in leaves, and GUI development for simulating Boolean networks</span>

An existing Boolean model of guard cell signaling in leaves, leading to the closure 
of stomata in response to a plant hormone ABA, was extended to include the effect of
CO<sub>2</sub>. The extended model, verified by conductance experiments in leaves, 
shows an additive effect of ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> on stomatal closure. An 
open-source GUI software to simulate and analyze user-defined Boolean networks was 
developed and used in this project, and was made available to the community.
